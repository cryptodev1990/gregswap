With the utmost enthusiasm I would like to put my name forward for your position of Back End Developer, which I saw advertised yesterday on the job website.

I have the ability to create back-end code that will add utility to everything the front-end designer creates. Iâ€™m passionate about the impact my skills can have in the real world, and firmly believe that I can create innovative solutions to business processes and problems which will ultimately lead to a better user experience.

With my previous experience in using an array of programming languages and my expertise at delivering high quality and user rich solutions on time, I see myself as a good fit for your role. I possess a proven and verifiable track record in building and managing mass-market ecommerce sites.

In short, I can bring to your company my ability to take finished front-end code and gives it working functionality. I possess an in-depth understanding of both front end and back end technologies, and am very good at defining what success looks like. Furthermore I am proficient in Microsoft and Web Technologies such as C#, ASP.Net, SQL Server, Visual Studio, HTML and CSS.

My ambition is to reach the very top of my profession and to work with other leading developers in this field. On a personal level I am able to both give and take feedback. Furthermore I am committed to constantly improving myself by learning new technologies and frameworks.

Right now I am looking for a full time position with a company like yours, where success is built on the quality of its people and its reputation.
